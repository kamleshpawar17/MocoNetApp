Click on **Choose Files** and select all the dicom files (*.dcm) for the scan, follwed by upload, which will display the motion degraded image in the left viewer

Click on **Process** to run the AI motion correction on the input image.

Click in **Download** to save motion corrected images. (It will be a zip file which contains all the precessed dicom images)
